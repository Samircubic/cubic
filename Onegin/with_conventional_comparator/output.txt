And there was no better deal.
Be quick and go straight to hell.
But, don't tell me how it bothers
He claimed respect from all his folks,
He is exemplary for others,
It is so vicious to beguile,
My uncle of the highest codes,
To entertain a moron,
To nurse a dummy day and night
To serve him medicine with a smile
To sigh while thinking: all goes well:
To straighten pillows with a moan,
When he became very ill,
With no single step aside!
